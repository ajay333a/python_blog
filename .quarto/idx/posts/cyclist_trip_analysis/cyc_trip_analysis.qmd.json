We can use `map` function to perform a function to all of the columns.\n\n```{python checking na}\ndf_1year = df_1year_raw.copy()\n\ndf_1year.isna().sum()\n```\n\n-   As NA's are not present in the times columns i.e, `started_at` and `ended_at` we don't need to worry ourselves about `NA` during aggregation and manipulation of data but it is a good practice to do so.\n\n-   Finding the length or duration of the rides by making a new column `ride_length` in minutes and making sure that the `ride_length` is not negative by using `if_else` function. Eliminating stations where station names and longitude and latitude co-ordinates are not present.\n\n```{python finding ride length}\n\n# Converting 'started_at' and 'ended_at' to datetime format\ndf_1year = df_1year.astype({'started_at': 'datetime64[ns]', 'ended_at': 'datetime64[ns]'})\n\n# Calculating ride length in minutes\ndf_1year['ride_length'] = (df_1year['ended_at'] -

ride\"** grouped by \"bike type\" and \"rider type\" after removing rides less than 2 minutes (As rides less than 2 minutes tend to have the same start and stop stations).\n\n```{python avg_min_per_ride}\n#| label: tbl-avg_ride_legnth\n#| tbl-cap: Average minutes per ride\n\ndf_1year_agg = (df_1year[df_1year['ride_length'] >= 2]\n                     .groupby(['rideable_type',

    )\n\ndf_1year_agg\n\n```\n\nWe can clearly notice in @tbl-avg_ride_legnth that **member** riders have more number of rides with both **classic and electric bikes** while the average ride length is higher with **casual** riders.\n\n-   Calculating and visualizing **Average ride length** by \"Rider type\".\n\n```{python Plot-Average ride length}\n#| label: fig-avg_ride_length\n#| fig-cap: Average

**Member riders** tend to use bikes more frequently than **casual riders**, especially during weekdays.\n-   **Casual riders** show a preference for weekends, with a significant increase in rides during Saturdays and Sundays.\n\n### Ride Length\n\n-   The average ride length is generally longer for **casual riders** compared to **member riders**.\n-   The longest average ride lengths occur on weekends, particularly for **casual riders**.\n\n### Seasonal Trends\n\n-   The number of rides fluctuates significantly throughout the year, with peaks in summer months (July and August) and a noticeable drop in winter months (January and February).\n-   The analysis indicates that weather and seasonal changes have a substantial impact on cycling patterns.\n-   The data suggests that **member riders** maintain a more consistent usage pattern throughout the year compared to **casual riders**.\n\n### Temporal Patterns\n\n-   Ride patterns vary by time of day, with peak usage in the morning and evening hours.\n-   The analysis highlights the importance of understanding temporal patterns to optimize bike availability and station placements.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n-   **Infrastructure Improvements**: Consider adding more bike stations in areas with high casual rider activity, especially during weekends.\n-   **Promotional Campaigns**: Encourage casual riders to become members by offering incentives, such as discounts or free trials, to increase overall ridership.\n-   **Seasonal Promotions**: Implement seasonal promotions to boost ridership during colder months, potentially by offering discounts or special events to attract casual riders.\n-   **Data-Driven Decisions**: Continue to analyze ride patterns regularly to adapt to changing user behaviors and preferences, ensuring that the bike-sharing system remains efficient and user-friendly."},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"cyc_trip_analysis.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
