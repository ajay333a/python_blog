We will be concentrating on data gathered in between *July-2022* to *June-2023* which will cover an entire year.\n\nLet's load the required packages first\n\n-   Loading the required packages i.e., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `plotly`.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Loading and Formatting Data\n\n-   Let's look at the structure of the data in one of the downloaded `.csv` files.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntrp_data_jul_24 = pd.read_csv(\"F:/Data_Sci/Cap_Stone_Project/Cyclist_trip_data/202207-divvy-tripdata/202207-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\n\ntrp_data_jul_24.info()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 823488 entries, 0 to 823487\nData columns (total 13 columns):\n #   Column              Non-Null Count   Dtype  \n---  ------              --------------   -----  \n 0   ride_id             823488 non-null  object \n 1   rideable_type       823488 non-null  object \n 2   started_at          823488 non-null  object \n 3   ended_at            823488 non-null  object \n 4   start_station_name  711457 non-null  object \n 5   start_station_id    711457 non-null  object \n 6   end_station_name    702537 non-null  object \n 7   end_station_id      702537 non-null  object \n 8   start_lat           823488 non-null  float64\n 9   start_lng           823488 non-null  float64\n 10  end_lat             822541 non-null  float64\n 11  end_lng             822541 non-null  float64\n 12  member_casual       823488 non-null  object \ndtypes: float64(4), object(9)\nmemory usage: 81.7+ MB\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Let's look at the columns and try to understand what they represent\n    -   `ride_id` is the unique identification token generated for each ride that was initiated.\n    -   `rideable_type` indicates the type of bike used for the ride.\n    -   `started_at` and `ended_at` give us the time when the ride began and the ride ended respectively.\n    -   `start_station_name` and `end_station_name` give us the names of stations where ride began and ended respectively.\n    -   `start_station_id` and `end_station_id` are unique ID's given to stations.\n    -   `start_lat` and `start_lng` represent co-ordinates where the ride began.\n    -   `end_lat` and `end_lng` represent co-ordinates where the ride stopped.\n    -   `member_casual` identifies if the rider is a member or casual rider of the bike.\n\nThe `trpdata_july_2022` contains `r nrow(trpdata_july_2022)` rows and `r ncol(trpdata_july_2022)` columns. In the results we can see all the columns and their data types.\n\n-   **Lets load data of remaining 11 months.**\n\n",
